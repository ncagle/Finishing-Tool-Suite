Preprocessing Trans
	•	Before anything else, integrate roads at all scales with default tolerance to get all intersection vertices
	•	Then Dissolve all Roads and unsplit lines with PSG attributes and metadata fields to pick up any shattered bits
	•	Then run Feature to Line to split Roads at intersections. Work backwards thru the scales so higher scale roads aren't split at every 12.5k road, but 12.5k roads are split wherever they need to be.
	•	Use a layer for each scale. then extract that scale from the combined output.
	•	500k Feature to Line
	•	250k + 500k layers Feature to Line. Extract 250k from output. etc.
	•	Alternatively, use the Intersect and Split Points at Line method with the 4 scale layers. might be more efficient for processing.
	•	Intersect 500k with itself and split with those points. then intersect 250k with 500k and split 250k with those points. etc.
	•   Integrate Roads with BUAs @ 0.01m tolerance to add and collapse intersection vertices (tolerance based on GAIT duplicate vertices check)
	•	Edge snap Roads to BUAs @ 1m tolerance. (tolerance based on GAIT line-area sliver check)
